## React Movie App 

The app is designed to allow users to search for movies based on their title, and once they find the movie they are looking for, they can view additional details about it. The app retrieves movie information using the OMDb API, which provides a comprehensive database of movies. 

The app allows users to enter a movie title into a search bar and then retrieve a list of movies that match their search query. The results page shows a list of matching movies, along with a brief summary of each movie, including the movie title, release year, and a thumbnail of the movie poster.

Overall, this movie app demonstrates the power and flexibility of ReactJS, as well as the usefulness of APIs like OMDb for accessing and displaying data from external sources.
